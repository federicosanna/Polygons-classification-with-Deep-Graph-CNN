# Script to generate input dataset to train the Graph dataset

# Usage Info:
# Every time that this script is run it writes into a file called
# POLY.txt a number of nodes (as specified in poly_to_generate) of
# the type either concave, convex, or both, as specified.
# For more flexibility the number of total graph needs to be specified
# by the user at the beginning of the file. This is to avoid that adding
# nodes results in corrupting the format of the file.
