# Polygons-classification-with-Deep-Graph-CNN
Implementation of a Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network to classify convex and concave polygons. Ultimate goal of this project is to be able to use Graph Nets as substitutes of Finite Element Methods (FEM).


The network architecture is based on the DGCNN implementation that you can find at: https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~muhan/papers/AAAI_2018_DGCNN.pdf
